# 🧠 Face Recognition App using Siamese Neural Network

This project implements a **real-time facial verification system** using a **Siamese Neural Network (SNN)** in TensorFlow and OpenCV. The model compares two images and predicts whether they belong to the **same person or not** — enabling **face verification**, not just classification.

## 🧪 What is a Siamese Network?

A **Siamese Neural Network** is a type of deep learning model that learns **similarity** between pairs of inputs. Instead of classifying individual images, it **compares two images** and outputs a similarity score.

### 🧬 Key Features:
- Two identical subnetworks (CNNs with shared weights)
- Embedding output of shape `(4096,)` for both images
- A custom **L1 Distance Layer** compares embeddings
- A sigmoid classifier predicts match probability

This approach enables **one-shot learning** — the model doesn't need retraining when new people are added.

## 🚀 Pipeline Overview

### 1. **Data Preparation**
- **Anchor Images**: Captured from webcam using key `'a'`
- **Positive Images**: Same person as anchor using key `'p'`
- **Negative Images**: Random faces from LFW dataset

### 2. **Preprocessing**
- Resize images to `(100, 100)`
- Normalize pixel values to range `[0, 1]`

### 3. **Model Architecture**
- CNN-based embedding network with multiple Conv2D layers
- Outputs a 4096-dimensional embedding
- Custom `L1Dist` layer to compute absolute difference
- Dense layer (sigmoid) for final prediction

### 4. **Training**
- Triplet input: Anchor, Positive, Negative
- Binary label: `1` if match, `0` if not
- Loss: **Binary Crossentropy**
- Optimizer: **Adam**

### 5. **Verification**
- Real-time webcam capture
- Predicts similarity score between test image and anchor

## 📦 Requirements

Install Python dependencies:

```bash
pip install tensorflow opencv-python matplotlib numpy 
```
If using Conda:
```bash
conda create -n face-rec-env python=3.11
conda activate face-rec-env
pip install tensorflow==2.18 opencv-python matplotlib numpy==1.26.4
```
## 📷 Running the Application

- Press **`a`** to capture **anchor** images  
- Press **`p`** to capture **positive** images  
- Press **`q`** to **quit** the capture loop  

> These images are saved into respective folders and later used to train and validate the Siamese Neural Network.
